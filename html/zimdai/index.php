            <h1>ZimDai: A Blueprint for an Economic Jailbreak</h1>
                <p>
                    ZimDai is a thorough investigation into the viability of boostrapping Dai adoption in Zimbabwe,
                    given the significant challenges any such endeavor faces today.
                    It is the result of two months of on-the-ground research by Logan, funded by Team Toast,
                    to analyze the market fit between DAIHard and the Zimbabwean market.
                </p><p>
                    This research has been decoupled from reliance on DAIHard and distilled into
                    <a href="https://github.com/coinop-logan/ZimDai/raw/master/whitepaper.pdf">The ZimDai Paper: A Blueprint for an Economic Jailbreak</a>.
                    Please take a look with a critical eye, and join the Telegram (link in paper) with any thoughts or questions.

                    Given a marketing drive, we may have on our hands a strikingly realistic,
                    immediately applicable plan to liberate the Zimbabwean citizenry from systemic financial abuse.
                    This has been a dream within crypto for years.
                    Perhaps today crypto can begin making these kinds of significant moves on the global stage.

                    If the Foundry sale accumulates significant funding, it could decide to fund and lead such a marketing campaign.
