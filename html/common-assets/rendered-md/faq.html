<h2 id="what-is-foundrydao">What is FoundryDAO?</h2>
<p>FoundryDAO is a for profit DAO that seeks to fund and profit from ventures in the blockchain space. ## What does DAO mean? DAOs are Distributed Autonomous Organizations. They are entities that live on the blockchain and directed by their smart contract code. There are several forms of DAOs. Blockchains (like Ethereum and Bitcoin) themselves are DAOs. DAOs typically incentivise people to act in a certain manner to further the interests of the DAO.</p>
<p>Taking Ethereum as an example. Ethereum incentivises users to use it by allowing them to run autonomous smart contracts and transfer value on a neutral platform. It charges these users a fee for doing this. The fee (and a block reward) are used to incentivize miners to run the Ethereum Software. Holders of Ethereum are incentivised to improve and market the system to increase the value of their Ether. By using carefully structured incentives, without being controlled by a single entity, Ethereum can grow and further itself.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-foundrydao-meant-to-accomplish">What is FoundryDAO meant to accomplish?</h2>
<p>To house and capture value from beneficial, but perhaps controversial, projects (such as SmokeSignal and DAIHard). Such projects are risky for individuals or institutions to publicly support, let alone profit from. FoundryDAO seeks to be able to do both.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-foundrydao-work">How does FoundryDAO work?</h2>
<p>FoundryDAO allows Foundry Token (FRY) holders to participate in a liquid democracy governance system where users can vote on proposals submitted to the Foundry for funding. Users can either vote on propositions directly, or <em>delegate</em> their votes to other users who they see as responsible. This will allow some users to specialize in making Foundry-related decisions.</p>
<h2 id="where-does-foundrydao-get-money">Where does FoundryDAO get money?</h2>
<p>FoundryDAO will get it's initial funding from the a token sale. The funds raised in the sale will go to the FoundryDAO treasury where they will be under the control of the Foundry governance mechanism.</p>
<p>FoundryDAO may, after it's initial presale, enter a &quot;perpetual sale&quot; where FRY tokens will continuously be sold of for funds. This would dilute existing holders, but preserve the value of their FRY tokens by pulling in more funds for the additional FRY minted. We will write more on this in the future.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-liquid-democracy">What is liquid democracy?</h2>
<p>Liquid democracy is a form of member managed governance that negates the need for a &quot;manager&quot; or &quot;executive&quot; tier in the organization, but allows for fine grained specialization to form. It works by allowing users to delegate their voting power to other users who they deem as prudent and informed about the proposals brought to the Foundry. Those users could themselves then re-delegate those votes to yet other users. This is beneficial in that it allows users to specialize in getting proficient at governance, while allowing people who do not wish to become experts in FoundryDAO's affairs to still invest, but offload their voting power to someone they trust.</p>
<h1 id="about-the-token-sale">About the token sale</h1>
<h2 id="doesnt-the-sec-have-a-major-problem-with-icos">Doesn't the SEC have a major problem with ICOs?</h2>
<p>Our token sale is not open to US investors, qualified or otherwise. We block participation from aggressive jurisdictions.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-participate">How do I participate?</h2>
<p>You can head over to sale.foundrydao.com once the sale starts. To participate you will need some Ether (ETH) for gas and DAI to purchase FRY with.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-get-dai">How do I get DAI?</h2>
<p>You can swap Ether for DAI on over at kyberswap.com, very cheaply and quickly, if you have Metamask.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-get-ether">How do I get Ether?</h2>
<p>This depends on your jurisdiction. Most countries have very reputable cryptocurrency exchanges at this point.</p>
<h2 id="where-does-the-money-go">Where does the money go?</h2>
<p>The money goes into a treasury contract which will be owned by the FoundryDAO's governance contract. Initially this contract will be a simple multisig controlled by the creators of the DAO, but as we develop the liquid democracy governance system, it will take over control of these funds. This will place all funds raised under direct control of the FRY token holders themselves.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-does-the-sale-last">How long does the sale last?</h2>
<p>Just under 18 months.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-fry-tokens-will-be-sold">How many FRY tokens will be sold?</h2>
<p>60,000,000 will be minted and sold in just under 20 months--30,000 every 7 hours after launch.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-fry-tokens-will-there-be">How many FRY tokens will there be?</h2>
<p>At the end of the sale, there will be 100,000,000 FRY tokens. After the initial sale, a perpetual sale may dilute FRY tokens at a rate of 5% per year in exchange for new, spendable funds in the treasury.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-a-pre-mine">Is there a &quot;pre-mine&quot;?</h2>
<p>30,000,000 FRY tokens will go to Team Toast. 10,000,000 FRY tokens will be put in the Foundry treasury itself, so governance can pull in more long term talent.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-the-money-be-used-for">What will the money be used for</h2>
<p>Initially there will be three proposals that participation in the sale will signal approval of. 1. A very modest budget to seed a larger team for SmokeSignal. 2. A very modest budget to seed a larger team for DAIHard. 3. Auditing budget for the seminal version of Foundry's liquid democracy. Thereafter all proposals will go through the FoundryDAO governance contract.</p>
<h2 id="what-if-i-dont-like-the-initial-projects">What if I don't like the initial projects?</h2>
<p>Then please do not send money to the Token Sale. Or wait until the full governance contract is up if you want the fully decentralized experience.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-is-the-sale-looking-to-raise">How much is the sale looking to raise?</h2>
<p>As much as the market deems appropriate. We will write more on our expectations and hopes for this before the sale launches.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-participate-1">How do I participate?</h2>
<p>To participate in the sale, you need a small amount of Ether for gas, and however much DAI you want to spend on FRY. This should be held in a web3 wallet to interact with the sale. We recommend the browser plugin Metamask.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-the-sale-work">How does the sale work?</h2>
<p>The sale has 2000 <em>buckets</em>, each of which will mint and sell 30,000 FRY. The first bucket closes 7 hours after the sale starts, the second one 7 hours after that, and so on. To participate, use the bucket sale interface that will be live at sale.foundrydao.com. There you will specify the bucket you want to enter (the current bucket or a future bucket) and send it DAI.</p>
<p>Once a bucket has concluded, you can withdraw your FRY tokens. You will receive your portion of 30,000 FRY tokens, proportional to your contribution of DAI to the bucket. If 1000 DAI total was provided to that bucket, of which you supplied 100 DAI, you will get 10%: 3,000 FRY tokens.</p>
<h2 id="will-foundrydao-be-live-before-the-sale-ends">Will FoundryDAO be live before the sale ends?</h2>
<p>Yes.</p>
<h1 id="about-referrals">About Referrals</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-the-goal-of-the-referral-program">What is the goal of the referral program?</h2>
<p>To incentivize marketers for bringing in participants to the sale and to retain marketing expertise within the FRY token holder group.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-using-a-referral-code-from-someone-else">What are the benefits of using a referral code from someone else?</h2>
<p>You will get 10% of the value you are entering into a sale bucket, also entered into the next sale bucket. So if you are buying 100 DAI in bucket 20, then you will also be credited for a purchase of 10 DAI in bucket 21. Note that the price of FRY will likely differ between these two buckets.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-sharing-a-referral-code">What are the benefits of sharing a referral code?</h2>
<p>When someone buys with your referral code, you are credited as if you bought into the next bucket. Your credit in the following bucket starts at 10% and can go as high as 100% of the purchase of the person buying with your referral code. The bonus % is based on the amount of total sales referred with your code; 1% for every 1,000 DAI raised. So if you generate a referral code and share it with someone and they buy 1,000 DAI in bucket 23, then you will be credited with a sale of 11% (110 DAI) in bucket 24. If someone later buys another 2,000 DAI in bucket 40 for instance, then you will be credited with 13% (130 DAI) in bucket 41.</p>
