                <p>
                    It's time for crypto to start making moves on the global stage.

                    <p>
                        The FRY Sale will mint and auction off 50,000 FRY every 7 hours
                        until a total of 60,000,000 FRY has been disbursed.
                        This will take just under 1 year.

                    <p>
                        Team Toast is designing a Liquid Democracy system
                        that allows Foundry to rely on FRY holders for intelligent decision-making,
                        while avoiding common pitfalls of DAO governance.

                    <p>
                        Foundry will accumulate FRY holders who believe in unstoppable economic freedom.
                        After DAIHard succeeds or fails, FRY holders will likely drive Foundry
                        to build or invest in similar pursuits: profitable tools that increase economic freedom which cannot be shut down.

                <p>Zimbabweans are trapped in an abusive economic system. But crypto is growing teeth.</p>
                <p>More on ZimDai --></p>
                <p>(quote) Zimbabwe suffers under incredibly irresponsible and abusive economic control.
                        The cryptocurrency industry and stack is now mature enough to
                        break the Zimbabwean citizens out of this economic prison.
                <h2>Zimbabwe's Plight</h2>
                    <p>
                        The official currency of Zimbabwe is rapidly inflating, and
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe">this is nothing new.</a>
                        It is practically impossible to save money in such an environment,
                        and entrepreneurship is being strangled.
                        Worse, the banking system significantly limits withdrawals, and ATMs simply don't work.
                        Internal political pressure has proven incapable of changing any of this.
                    </p>
                <h2>Blueprint For an Economic Jailbreak</h2>

                        is a thorough investigation into the viability of boostrapping Dai adoption in Zimbabwe,
                        given the significant challenges any such endeavor faces today.
                        It assumes a hostile state and does not ask for permission.
                        It is the result of two months of on-the-ground research by Logan, funded by Team Toast.

                <h2>The Missing Piece</h2>
                    <p>
                        What's needed is a marketing drive. With both marketing leadership and funding,
                        we may have on our hands a strikingly realistic, immediately applicable plan
                        to liberate the Zimbabwean citizenry from systemic financial abuse.
                        This has been a dream within crypto for years.
                        Given significant funding, we expect Foundry to lead and fund this campaign.
