# FoundyDAO FAQ

# About FoundryDAO
## What is FoundryDAO?
FoundryDAO is a for profit DAO that seeks to fund and profit from ventures in the blockchain space.
## What does DAO mean?
DAOs are Distributed Autonomous Organizations. They are entities that live on the blockchain and directed by their smart contract code. There are several forms of DAOs. Blockchains (like Ethereum and Bitcoin) themselves are DAOs. DAOs typically incentivise people to act in a certain manner to further the interests of the DAO.  

Taking Ethereum as an example. Ethereum incentivises users to use it by allowing them to run autonomous smart contracts and transfer value on a neutral platform. It charges these users a fee for doing this. The fee (and a block reward) are used to incentivize miners to run the Ethereum Software. Holders of Ethereum are incentivised to improve and market the system to increase the value of their Ether. By using carefully structured incentives, without being controlled by a single entity, Ethereum can grow and further itself. 

## What is FoundryDAO meant to accomplish?
To house and capture value from beneficial, but perhaps controversial, projects (such as SmokeSignal). Many existing funds can either not be associated with such projects or not gain financial benefit from such projects. FoundryDAO seeks to be able to do both. 

## How does FoundryDAO work?
FoundryDAO allows Foundry Token (FRY) holders to participate in a liquid democracy governance system where users can vote on proposals submitted to the Foundry for funding. Every token vote is equally weighted and users can specialize in governance matters by having others delegate tokens to them. These tokens will still belong 100% to the original holders but the user who has been delegated to will have a bigger say in if proposals are passed or declined.

## Where does FoundryDAO get money?
FoundryDAO will get it's initial funding from the a token presale. The funds raised in the presale will go to the FoundryDAO treasury where they will be under the control of the Foundry governance mechanism. 

FoundryDAO will, after it's initial presale, enter a "perpetual sale" where FRY tokens will continuously be sold of for funds. This sale will dilute existing holder at a rate of 5% per year but preserve the value of their FRY tokens by increasing the FoundryDAO treasury by an equivalent amount. This will also maximally distribute Foundry's membership making it hard for early participants to monopolize but at the same time rewarding them for their early support. 

FoundryDAO's cash flow come from the project incomes that it has invested in. These will predominantly be dApps on the Ethereum blockchain. If FRY token holders act wisely the treasury will grow, if they act poorly it will shrink.

## What is liquid democracy?
Liquid democracy is a form of member managed governance that negates the need for a "manager" or "executive" tier in the organization, but allows for fine grained specialization to form. It works by allowing users to delegate their voting power to other users who they deem as prudent and informed about the proposals brought to the Foundry. Those users could themselves then re-delegate those votes to yet other users. This is beneficial in that it allows users to specialize in getting proficient at governance, while allowing people who do not wish to become experts in FoundryDAO's affairs to still invest, but seed their voting power with someone they trust. 

# About the ICO
## Doesn't the SEC have a major problem with ICOs?
Our ICO is not open to US investors, qualified or otherwise. We block participation from aggressive jurisdictions. 

## How do I participate?
You can head over to sale.foundrydao.com  
To participate you will need some Ether (Eth) for gas and DAI to purchase FRY with. 

## How do I get DAI?
You can swap Ether for DAI on over at kyberswap.com

## How do I get Ether?
This depends on your jurisdiction. Most countries have very reputable crypto currency exchanges at this point. 

## Where does the money go?
The money goes into a treasury contract which will be owned by the FoundryDAO's governance contract. Initially this contract will be a simple multisig controlled by the creators of the DAO, but soon thereafter, once auditing of the v.1 smart contract is complete, will move entirely to the liquid democracy governance contract. This will place all funds raised under direct control of the FRY token holders themselves.

## How long does the sale last?
Just under 18 months.

## How many FRY tokens will be sold?
60,000,000 will be sold. 33,333 every 7 hours. 

## How many FRY tokens will there be?
At the end of the sale, there will be 100,000,000 FRY tokens. 
After the initial sale, the perpetual sale will dilute FRY tokens at a rate of 5% per year in exchange for new, spendable funds in the treasury. 

## Is there a "pre-mine"?
30,000,000 FRY tokens will go to the initial team in vesting contracts to ensure their continued participation.
10,000,000 FRY tokens will be put in the Foundry treasury itself to pull in more long term talent. 

## --Doesn't that put disproportionate power in the hands of the creators of FoundryDAO?--
At first the creators will have considerable power, that power will soon dwindle as not all their tokens will be available for voting or sale and more participants can enter the governance process. 
Over the longer time scale, the continuous sale will constantly dilute control of the earlier participants, but not token value. 

## What will the money be used for
Initially there will be three proposals that participation in the ICO will signal approval of. 
1. A very modest budget to seed a larger team for SmokeSignal.
2. A very modest budget to seed a larger team for DAIHard.
3. Auditing budget for the seminal version of Foundry's liquid democracy.
Thereafter all proposals will go through the FoundryDAO governance contract. 

## What if I don't like the initial projects?
Then please do not send money to the ICO. Or wait until the full governance contract is up if you want the fully decentralized experience. 

## How much is the sale looking to raise?
As much as the market deems appropriate.
The first two proposals are $ 123 for DAIHard and $456 for SmokeSignal.

## What is the "continuous sale"?
FoundryDAO is not a closed fund. It will continue to sell FRY at a conservative rate in perpetuity. It does this to ensure it always DAI funds it can spend and always pulls in fresh participants. 

## Won't the "continuous sale" dilute my FRY tokens?
While the sale dilutes your % share of control of Foundry, is does not dilute the value, because the dilution is offset by an equivalent increase in the assets controlled by Foundry.

## How do I participate?
To participate in the ICO, you need a small amount of Ether for gas and DAI. If you go to sale.foundrydao.com using the MetaMask or Nifty Wallet browser plug-ins is the way. The sale also works with the MetaMask mobile wallet and TrustWallet.

## How does the sale work?
The sale has 1855 rounds of 30,000 FRY tokens each. Each round is 7 hours long. To participate you send DAI to the sale, specifying the current bucket or a future bucket. You cannot participate in past buckets.
Once a bucket has concluded, you can withdraw your FRY tokens. You will receive your portion of 30,000 FRY tokens, proportional to your contribution of DAI to the bucket. If 1000 DAI was provided to that bucket, of which you supplied 100 DAI, you will get 10% or 3,000 FRY tokens. 

## Will FoundryDAO be live before the sale ends?
Yes.

# About Referrals
## What is the goal of the referral program?
To incentivize marketers for bringing in participants to the sale and to retain marketing expertise within the FRY token holder group. 

## What are the benefits of using a referral code from someone else?
You will get 10% of the value you are entering into a sale bucket, also entered into the next sale bucket. So if you are buying 100 DAI in bucket 20, then you will also be credited for a purchase of 10 DAI in bucket 21. The amount of FRY you get in out of bucket 21 might not be 10% of that you got out of bucket 20 because the value entered into the buckets may differ. 

## What are the benefits of sharing a referral code?
When someone buys with your referral code, you are credited as if you bought into the next bucket. Your credit in the following bucket starts at 10% and can go as high as 100% of the purchase of the person buying with your referral code. The bonus % is based on the amount of total sales referred with your code; 1% for every 1,000 DAI raised. 
So if you generate a referral code and share it with someone and they buy 1,000 DAI in bucket 23, then you will be credited with a sale of 11% (110 DAI) in bucket 24. If someone later buys another 2,000 DAI in bucket 40 for instance, then you will be credited with 13% (130 DAI) in bucket 41.  

## How do I make a referral link?
Visit sale.foundrydao.com, you will be prompted if you are not using a referral code with the words "No Referral Bonus" in the top right corner of the sale block. If you click it you will see an explainer modal with a button you can click to generate one. You can then copy it by clicking "Copy Link".

## Where do I find my referral link if I've already made it? 
Go to sale.foundrydao.com, in the top right of the sale block, you will either see "Referral Bonus Active" or ""No Referral Bonus". Clicking will open a modal that will allow you to copy it to your clipboard for sharing with others.
